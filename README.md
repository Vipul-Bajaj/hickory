### ‚ö†Ô∏è HEAVILY UNDER DEVELOPMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Current API** ... will definitely change



#### Schedule:

`hickory schedule tryme.py`

`hickory schedule tryme.py --interval=10 --run_at_load=True`

TODO: calendar interval, finalize command (start? load? run?)




#### To see all running scripts:

`hickory list`

TODO: would be nice to see number of times triggered, when it was started, uptime, if it's still running, id?, script path? maybe use rich...




#### To stop/kill/and delete:

`hickory kill tryme.py`

TODO: decide if I want a pause? probably not... easy to just reschedule



Add some gifs and shit...



#### install for now:

Clone and cd into this repo, the run...

`pip install -e .`
